        <p>
          We define the word <span>hunger</span> as a period in which people experience severe food insecurity. Around the world, more than enough food is being produced every single day to feed the global population, and even with these brilliant efforts, as many as 828 million people still go hungry. We are talking about nearly 10% of Earth's population being affected by such a thing. It is a tragedy that millions of people still live through such hard conditions, even with such great advances being made every single day by millions of professionals to improve our overall daily lives and improve mankind.

        <p>
          Is inflation a cause for starvation? People need to have some sort of financial income if they want to be able to afford food. It is long known that poverty is a big reason for starvation. When people are in a state of poverty, they of course lack the resources to cover their basic needs such as food, water, and shelter making such individuals lack the necessary nutrients to survive. People who live in such conditions usually use inappropriate care practices and live in unsafe environments, which tend to have low access to quality water, sanitation, hygiene, health services and many more necessary needs for that person to live a normal human life.
